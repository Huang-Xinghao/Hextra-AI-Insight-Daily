# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** (or "the Site" / "we" as we'll call it) welcomes you! Before you dive into our services, seriously, give these Terms of Service a quick read. By just being here or using anything we offer, you're basically giving us a big "YES" to these terms. 👍

## 1. About Our Services
Our services? Well, the Site offers users a bunch of paid subscription content and membership goodies. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions – and that's just scratching the surface! Just so you know, some of the best stuff is exclusively for our subscribed members. 💎

## 2. User Accounts & Registration
- To get an account, users need to provide a valid email and pick a strong password. Pretty standard stuff!
- Your account is your baby! Users are totally responsible for its security and everything that happens with it. And hey, **don't even think about transferring or sharing** it. That's a big no-no. 🙅‍♀️
- Break these terms, and the Site has the full right to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Just a heads up!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services? They're billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs upfront on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
- All payments roll through secure third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal). Good news: the Site never stores your payment deets! 🛡️
- Heads up: your subscription will **automatically renew**! So, if you want to bail, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy is pretty sweet**: If you're a first-time subscriber and aren't totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just ping us at the contact email listed at the bottom of these terms and let us know what went wrong. Remember, this is a one-time deal per user! After 14 days, or if you've subscribed before, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- About our content: all original goodies are **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Seriously, don't even think about copying, reprinting, or using them for commercial stuff without getting our green light first. It's our baby! 👶
- As a user, you're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** – basically, it's just for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- Got commercial plans or want to quote us extensively? Awesome! Just hit up the Site to get the proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Let's talk user conduct. It's an absolute **no-go** to upload, post, or share anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or anything that steps on other people's rights. Keep it cool, folks! 🚫
- Also, **don't even think about** using tech tricks to bulk download, crawl, or crack our awesome member content. That's just sneaky!
- If you mess up, the Site has every right to remove any inappropriate content and even **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider this your friendly warning! 😉

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Heads up about our services: We totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a prior heads-up. Just how it goes sometimes!
- And if, for some wild reason (like an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service going down), our content is temporarily unavailable, the Site is **not on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it's out of our hands! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- Here's a quick disclaimer: The info we spill on the Site is purely for your reference. It's definitely **not meant to be** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So, don't take it as gospel!
- And hey, if you happen to run into any direct or indirect losses because you used our content or services, the Site is **absolutely not on the hook** for that. Just putting it out there! 🚫

## 8. Governing Law
- Alright, let's get legal! These Terms of Service are rock solid under the laws of the State of California, USA, and that's how we'll interpret them, no weird legal conflicts allowed.
- Got a beef related to these terms? First off, let's try to hash it out nicely and amicably. If we can't quite get there, you agree that any disputes will be settled in the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. So, California it is! 🌴
